Dataset of 6,418 customers analyzed for churn behavior.

Found a 26% churn rate, mostly from customers with <12 months tenure.

High-risk churn group: users with high monthly charges but no backup services.

Built an interactive dashboard for HR/Marketing with slicers by age, state, service type, and tenure group.

Churn was highest among short-tenure and high-charge users — key targets for retention.
